## Debugging

Edit the following lines below and list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" or "effort based" exercise meaning, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging and have knowledge of how to use a debugger.
