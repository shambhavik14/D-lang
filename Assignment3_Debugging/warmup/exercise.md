## Debugging

Edit the following lines below and list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" or "effort based" exercise meaning, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging and have knowledge of how to use a debugger.

1. I learned that gdb does not work on windows command line prompt. In order to debug a .d program in windows we have to either use D extension in VScode or VisualD 
2. In order to debug a file in VS Code, we need to first execute the file using debug flags and then create launch.json file and give path for executable file.
