# Part 2

> Functional Exercisees

## Logistics

You will be working on your own laptop today modifying files in the [./src.main.d](./src/main.d) 

## Task 1 - Functional

In this exercise you will implement a few functions in a purely functional style. This is again to get you thinking about how to write code that might be easier to avoid bugs (i.e. avoiding loops)/

You will have several functions provided and some examples of the result.

Here's the catch, you should implement each of these in **exactly 1 line of code**. Using universal function call syntax (UFCS) and functional style however, this shouldn't be a problem.

## Helpful Resources

Some additional resources to help you through this lab assignment

1. Investigate the [std.algortihm](https://dlang.org/library/std/algorithm.html) library and [std.range](https://dlang.org/library/std/range.html) library

## Deliverables

- A completed [./src/main.d](./src/main.d) file.

## Going Further

What is that, you finished Early? Did you enjoy this lab? Here are some (optional) ways to further this assignment.

## Found a bug?

If you found a mistake (big or small, including spelling mistakes) in this lab, kindly send me an e-mail. It is not seen as nitpicky, but appreciated! (Or rather, future generations of students will appreciate it!)

- Fun fact: The famous computer scientist Donald Knuth would pay folks one $2.56 for errors in his published works. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check)]
- Unfortunately, there is no monetary reward in this course :)
