# Exercise (Modify and then commit this file with your answers below)

1. Briefly summarize the project that you have found.

*Write a few sentences here about the project*

2. Look at the last commit message, what was the last change to the project in the github commit history (If for some reason your project does not have a repo, find a different project).

*Write a few sentences here if you were able to figure out what change was made. If you were not, specify the commit message (or lack of a message) and note that there was no descriptive message, but take a best guess at the change made*

3. How large was the last commit? Was it several files or just a small change?

*Write a few sentences here describing the size of the commit message*

4. Why might smaller commit messages be more useful?

*Write your response here*

5. Browse through some of the files. Do you see a preference towards usage of classes or structs? Does the project utilize inheritance?

*Write your response here*

6. Find a snippet of D code that you have not yet previously learned about in class (i.e. we know about things like 'auto', 'pointers', 'struct', 'class'). Describe the feature or syntax you found. As best as you can, do you think that was an appropriate use of the feature. If you're not sure, state that you are unsure and that you are making your best guess.

*Write your response here*
