# Assignment - D

> "It's time to learn a new language."

*It's time. You think to yourself. It's time to start looking for some work and begin your journey as a software engineer. There's no right path, and you'll take many twists and turns throughout your career, but you will find your path.*

*One thing that you can be assured of however, is that you can always be building your skillset. As you prepare yourself, you say to yourself, why not learn something new? Why not look at something that will challenge me, or perhaps just give me another tool I can leverage.*

*You type in 'D language' in your browsers search bar, and click 'go'*

## Description

Your task for this assignment is to spend time getting acquainted to the D language.  

It is nice sometimes to start a semester and sit down and try to learn a technology or langauge properly, and that is the goal of this first assignment. It's the first step we need to take to move onto more software engineering of projects!

**Note:** I don't care what IDE or text editor you use in this course. I typically will use VIM, though you might find other nice tools.

# Task 1

For task 1, I want you to go through the [dlang tour](https://tour.dlang.org/) and write at least 5 different D programs. 

- You will create these in each of the exercises in the [./exercises](./exercises) folder. 
- I recommend you choose topics such as: arrays, slices, associative arrays, classes, and templates.
	- Some of these topics may be more or less familiar to you, so choose as you like.
	- Your samples need not be long (just a few lines), but again just showing that you explored a feature.
		- i.e. more than just printing "hello world".
		- e.g. Try printing out instead the first 20 fibonacci numbers.
		- e.g. Try creating a small guessing game.
		- e.g. Try concatenatig tw dynamic arrays and sorting the values and filtering out odd numberes.	 
	- Have fun -- this is your chance to explore D!

# Task 2

You're given the following two files: [./src/cars.d](./src/cars.d) and [./data/data.json](./data/data.json).

- Write a program that prints out all of the cars that have four doors.
	- This should be a relatively short exercise, but I want you to start exploring some of the APIs.
	- We'll be working with data in this course, so take time to explore some of the libraries (like std.json, std.csv, curl, etc.) that are available.

# Submission/Deliverables

### Submission

- Commit all of your files to github, including any additional files you create.
- Do not commit any binary files unless told to do so.
- Do not commit any 'data' files generated when executing a binary.

### Deliverables

- Commit five working exercises in [./exercises](./exercises)
- Commit a working [./src/cars.d](./src/cars.d) file.

# Going Further

An optional task(if any) that will reinforce your learning throughout the semester--this is not graded.

1. Building a C++ String Library: https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/C-Building-String-Library/379656-2.html
	- A pragmatic project to exercise your C++ skills.
2. More C++: https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/C-Advanced-Programming-Topics/782128-2.html
	- Classes, and more.
3. https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/C-Essential-Training/772322-2.html
	- Useful introduction for C++ in about 5 hours of video.

# F.A.Q. (Instructor Anticipated Questions)

1. Q: Can I do some other video tutorial if I am an expert at C++?
	- A: Yes, but verify with your instructor first in a private piazza post.
2. Q: Which IDE should I be using in this class?
	- A: Use whatever IDE you want. At some point you will have to use tools on the command-line, but otherwise I do not care if you use VIM, Visual Studio, XCode, QT, etc. If you use a less popular tool, the course staff may have to take some additional time to learn (as well as your future team members!)
3. Q: Do I have to watch every single bit of the tutorial?
	- A: You can change the playback speed to be 2x for parts you may know well. Extra practice never hurts!
	- A: To be honest, now is not the time to skip tutorials to save time--learn the stuff now while things are slower in the semester (In this course and your other courses).
